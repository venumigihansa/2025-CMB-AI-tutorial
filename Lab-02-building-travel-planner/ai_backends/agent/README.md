# Agent

## Description
Main agent for the travel planning application. This comprehensive AI agent uses multiple tools and external integrations to assist users in planning their perfect trip itineraries. The agent considers user preferences, hotel availability, and provides personalized recommendations.

## Python Migration
The FastAPI/LangGraph migration of this agent lives in `python_migration/`.

Run it with:

```bash
cd Lab-02-building-travel-planner/ai_backends/agent/python_migration
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9090
```

## LLM Pattern
This project implements an **Advanced Multi-Tool Agent Pattern** where:
- Complex travel planning logic with multiple external API integrations
- Tool-calling capabilities for hotel search, booking, and policy queries
- Personalized recommendations based on user profiles
- Multi-step reasoning for itinerary planning
- CORS-enabled web service for frontend integration

## Configuration

Create a `Config.toml` file in the project root with the following structure:

```toml
# User identification for personalized services
userId = "user_john_001"

# PostgreSQL database connection for user profiles
pgHost = "localhost"
pgPort = 5432
pgDatabase = "travel_planning"
pgUser = "postgres"
pgPassword = "your_password"

# Pinecone vector database for policy retrieval
pineconeApiKey = "your-pinecone-api-key"
pineconeServiceUrl = "https://your-index-xxxxxx.svc.your-region.pinecone.io"

# External hotel service APIs
hotelSearchApiUrl = "http://localhost:9083"
bookingApiUrl = "http://localhost:9081"
```

Additionally, Go to VSCode Command palette(View -> Command Palette) and search for "Configure Default wso2 model provider" to set up the default model provider configuration.

### Configuration Notes
- `userId`: Default user identifier for personalization and profile retrieval
- `pgHost`, `pgPort`, `pgDatabase`, `pgUser`, `pgPassword`: PostgreSQL connection for accessing user profiles and preferences
- `pineconeApiKey`, `pineconeServiceUrl`: Vector database access for policy and document retrieval
- `hotelSearchApiUrl`: API endpoint for hotel search and availability checking
- `bookingApiUrl`: API endpoint for creating hotel bookings
- Initialize the personalization table with `resources/create_tables.sql` in the lab root before using profile features.
- You can point `hotelSearchApiUrl` and `bookingApiUrl` to either the Ballerina services (`o2-business-apis/`) or the Python services (`o2-business-apis-python/`).
